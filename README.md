HTML: 

- We have an input field to enter tasks, a button to add tasks, and an unordered list to display the tasks.


JavaScript:

- We add an event listener to the "Add Task" button.
- When the button is clicked, we get the value from the input field.
- If the input is not empty, we create a new list item (li) and a "Remove" button.
- We append the "Remove" button to the list item and the list item to the task list.
- We add an event listener to the "Remove" button to remove the task when clicked.
- This is a simple example of how you can use plain JavaScript to create a functional application without any frameworks like React.
